        <b>"Just to get high, just to realise. Everything I need is on the ground"</b><br><br><br><br><br><br>
        YG엔터테인먼트 소속 4인조 걸그룹 BLACKPINK의 멤버. 그룹에서 메인보컬과 리드댄서를 담당하고 있다.<br>
        독특하고 관능적인 음색을 주 무기로 사용하는 가수로서 매혹적이지만 한편으로는 유리알처럼 맑고 선명한 매력적인 음색을 소유하고 있다.<br>
        블랙핑크의 팬이 아닌 사람조차 로제의 목소리는 쉽게 구별할 수 있을정도다.<br>
        메인보컬로서 주로 찐득한 음색과 뛰어난 가창력으로 BLACKPINK에서 음악성의 중심을 단단히 잡아주는 역할을 한다.<br>
        BLACKPINK 곡들의 춤 난이도 또한 어렵고 격함에도 불구하고 로제는 춤출 때나 라이브에서 꽤나 안정적으로 고음을 낼 수 있다.<br>
        다만 춤추면서 불러서 그런지 호흡 컨트롤이 미숙하여 다른 멤버보다 간혹 음정이 불안할 때가 종종 있는데, 이 점은 수려한 기교로 장식하여 더 매력적으로 들리게 한다.</p>

            <h3>On The Ground</h3>
            <p>My life's been magic seems fantastic<br>
                I used to have a hole in the wall with a mattress<br>
                It’s funny when you want it<br>
                Suddenly you have it<br>
                You find out that your gold’s just plastic<br>
                <br>
                Every day every night<br>
                I’ve been thinking back on you and I<br>
                Every day every night<br>
                <br>
                I worked my whole life<br>
                Just to get right just to be like<br>
                Look at me I’m never coming down<br>
                <br>
                I worked my whole life<br>
                Just to get high just to realize<br>
                Everything I need is on the<br>
                Everything I need is on the ground<br>
                On the ground<br>
                Everything I need is on the ground<br>
                <br>
                Nah but they don’t hear me though (Yeah what goes up it must come down)<br>
                Nah but they don’t hear me though (You’re running out of time)<br>
                <br>
                My world’s been hectic seems electric<br>
                But I’ve been waking up with your voice in my head<br>
                And I’m trying to send a message<br>
                And let you know that every single minute I’m without you I regret it<br>
                <br>
                Every day every night I<br>
                ’ve been thinking back on you and I<br>
                Every day every night<br>
                <br>
                I worked my whole life<br>
                Just to get right just to be like<br>
                Look at me I’m never coming down<br>
                <br>
                I worked my whole life<br>
                Just to get high just to realize<br>
                Everything I need is on the<br>
                Everything I need is on the ground<br>
                On the ground<br>

                Nah but they don’t hear me though (You’re running out of time)<br>
                <br>
                I’m way up in the clouds<br>
                And they say I’ve made it now<br>
                But I figured it out<br>
                Everything I need is on the ground<br>
                <br>
                Just drove by your house<br>
                So far from you now<br>
                But I figured it out<br>
                Everything I need is on the<br>
                Everything I need is on the ground<br>
                <br>
                On the ground<br>
                Everything I need is on the ground<br>
                Nah but they don’t hear me though<br>
                On the ground<br>
